        "Description": "On top of Ring Mountain in Tiburon, Split and Turtle Rock offer a 360&#176; view of the Bay area.<br><br>Split Rock is a 30' rock bisected by a chimney. It mostly consists of 5.3 - 5.8 top rope climbs and some more difficult lines inside the split. The top roping here requires parties build there own anchors and thus can and should only be attempted by those very familiar with trad placements and nut equalization as the best anchors at Split Rock tend to include a combination of one (or more) small cam placement(s) and a series of equalized stoppers in the cracks running along the flat top of the rock. Make sure to bring long webbing to extend your anchor out across the chimney and over the lip.<br><br>Turtle Rock is a short hike away from Split Rock up over the hill and to the right. It offers some of the best bouldering in the Bay. It features really enjoyable and easy to moderate bouldering. There are a few more difficult (and higher) problems, but the bulk of the climbing is V-fun. Many different routes and variations exist, and its generally fun to skip the routine of picking routes based on this guide and to instead create your own lines (in a sense) depending on what variations and/or problems appeal to you. All routes can be walked off.<br><br><b> Beware: </b> At Turtle Rock there is often poison oak at the incut base of the rock. It is hard to see because of the tall grass that covers the top of Ring Mountain. You'll want to make sure you aren't pushing your crash pad into the Poison Oak should any be present at the time of your visit.",
        "Climbing Season": "Any time of the year. It can get a little sunny so avoid afternoons on hot days if possible.",
        "Dogs": "Allowed but on leash (you can get a ticket from the Ranger)."
