        "Description": "Located on the Marin Headlands, Genocide Rock provides a few highballs, a couple of traverses and steep sit starts. A cool standalone chert boulder with faces up to about 20 feet high, Genocide Rock has some possible bouldering problems. The top of this standalone chert boulder provides spectacular views of the Bay (and Golden Gate bridge). There is some poison oak around this area that can be avoided.",
        "When To Go": "Weather is usually not a problem for climbing. It can get cold because of the winds from Rodeo Beach so be prepared and bring a jacket.",
        "Gear": "There is only one sub-par hanger less bolt at the top. Long slings and possibly a second rope to sling a block way back from the edge. There's also a 1\" - 2\" cam flake immediately behind the bolt, but it's loose - don't trust it!"
