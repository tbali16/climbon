        "Description": "Lyme Disease Rock is a gem of the area. It is a 50 foot tall sandstone formation located mere yards off Skyline Blvd, yet it is not as crowded as nearby Indian or Castle Rocks. A handful of sport routes exist here including two fun 5.10b's and some .11's. Easy access to the top of the rock makes setting up TR a pinch.",
        "Gear": "8-10 quick draws (plus ropes) for sport climbing. ",
        "Dogs": "Allowed on leash.",
        "Climbing Season": "Avoid climbing for several days (minimum should be two) after it has rained. Otherwise, this rock is good to climb any time of the year."
