      "Description": "Western Addition is a set of rocks inside Castle Rock - Chew Tooth, Shady Rock, Platypus Rock. Chew Tooth, known for it's love for chewing ropes, is a 30 foot high rock with both challenging and warm-up routes. All routes off the Chew Tooth can be lowered off.",
      "Climbing Season": "Compared to other spots inside Castle Rock, these rocks are relatively empty. They are hidden from the sun and good to climb if it is not raining.",
      "Dogs": "Not allowed at Castle Rock State Park. They are allowed on leash at Indian Rock (across the street).",
      "Fees": "There is an $8 day use fee. If you want to avoid this parking fees, you can always park outside the main parking lot (there is almost always room).",
      "The Rock": "The uniquely shaped sandstone, with its caves, pockets, and bulbous features, is probably the main attraction for tourists, hikers, and of course, climbers at Castle Rock State Park. The sandstone, known as Vaqueros sandstone, has pockets and caves called tafoni carved out of it. In addition to the tafoni, the sandstone has honeycombed features, or fretwork, as well as large round spheres sticking out from the rock, what geologists refer to as cannonballs. <br><br>Over time, erosion has exposed the outer surface of the rock, which changes slowly due to weather factors such as rain and wind. The area is in an active fault zone. The epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, a 7.2 on the richter scale, was not far from here, and the San Andreas Fault divides the Los Trancos Open Space Preserve, only 9 miles to the north."
