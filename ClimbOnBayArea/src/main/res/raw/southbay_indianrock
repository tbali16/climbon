        "Description": "Indian Rock is located right next to historical Castle Rock. With boulders as high as 10 feet and sport lines extending 120 feet, Indian Rock offers an incredible alternative to Castle Rock. The boulders are mostly situated next to the main rock under the cool shade surrounded by trees on all sides. The rock is similar to Castle Rock (Vaqueros Sandstone).",
        "The Rock": "The uniquely shaped sandstone, with its caves, pockets, and bulbous features, is probably the main attraction for tourists, hikers, and of course, climbers at Castle Rock State Park. The sandstone, known as Vaqueros sandstone, has pockets and caves called tafoni carved out of it. In addition to the tafoni, the sandstone has honeycombed features, or fretwork, as well as large round spheres sticking out from the rock, what geologists refer to as cannonballs.<br><br>Over time, erosion has exposed the outer surface of the rock, which changes slowly due to weather factors such as rain and wind. The area is in an active fault zone. The epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, a 7.2 on the richter scale, was not far from here, and the San Andreas Fault divides the Los Trancos Open Space Preserve, only 9 miles to the north.",
        "When to go": "Avoid climbing for several days (minimum should be two) after it has rained. The sandstone here is very fragile and critical holds on well loved problems have been known to break. If there is no rain, this rock is good to climb any time of the year.",
        "Dogs": "Allowed on leash.",
        "Gear": "Crash pad for bouldering. 10 quick draws and long slings for set-back anchors on top. 4\" cam to lead Krokus."
