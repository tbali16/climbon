        "Description": "Mount Tamalpais is the most popular outdoors playground in San Francisco Bay Area. It is also the high point of Marin County, California. The mountain is a east-west trending ridge rising dramatically over the surrounding cities and hills, about 10 miles as crow flies north of San Francisco. It has steep slopes on all sides, bounded on the west and south by sea cliffs. From most parts of the mountain there are simply stunning views of the ocean, bay, cities, bridges, rocky outcrops, dense forests, wild flowers, water falls, dramatic ocean cliffs, beaches, pounding surf, fog clouds and sunsets.<br><br>Most of the climbs at \"Mount Tam\" range from 5.3 - 5.11b and are top-roped. It is also a great place to learn trad climbing.  There are many great bouldering areas all over Mt Tam since a recent surge in development starting about 2005. The mountain now hosts about 125 boulder problems from VB-V9 and counting! The highest concentration of problems are at The Lakeview Boulders off Lakeview Trail on the north side of the mountain. The rest of the problems are all spread out at smaller roadside areas on the way up to the East Peak.",
        "Climbing Season": "Mt Tam escapes most of the fog and mist that covers the other spots in the North Bay. The park is open from 7:00 AM to sunset. Some rocks can get hot during the day. Southern Formation and Oberman Rock are shady throughout the day. Northern Formation is sunny during the morning. Some of the bouldering problems lie in the shade. Autumn is the best season to go.",
        "Parking Fees": "There is an $8 parking fee if you plan to park at the summit (where all the top-rope rocks reside).",
        "Dogs": "Mostly on leash. Check trailhead for rules.",
        "The Rock":  "The rock at Mount Tamalpais is mineral serpentine, resulting in very featured rock and cracks perfect for learning and practicing many climbing techniques. Rock height ranges from 40-60 feet, ranging from fun slabs to exciting roofs!<br><br>The mountain marks the site of a former subduction zone, due to the fact that it was ocean crust, which has been hydrothermally altered. Serpentinization is the process of removing calcium from rocks, replacing it with magnesium. The serpentinization occurred when the rock was ocean crust. Hot water percolated through the crust altering it into the formation, which now stands. Very few plants can live in soil without calcium, besides chaparral (pines and manzanita) which cover a good portion of the mountain. Serpentine is the state rock of California."
