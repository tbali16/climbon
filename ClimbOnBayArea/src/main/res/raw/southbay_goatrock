        "Description": "Several climbing spots can be found on the trail to Goat Rock - Last Temptation Cliff, Billy Goat Rock, Bawling Boulders and Goat Rock.<br><br>Goat Rock is one of the well-known climbing spots along Skyline Ridge in the South Bay. Located just off of CA 35 in Castle Rock State Park, Goat Rock is a 100 foot sandstone monolith with impressive views of the Santa Cruz Mountains along with many routes that rate from 5.6 to 5.12. Erosion from wind, water, and sun have created an interesting rock pattern filled with many small pockets and caves: perfect for climbing. Goat Rock is mostly top roped, and it can get pretty crowded during a summer afternoon. Climbing early to beat the heat and crowds is recommended. From the parking lot on Skyline Blvd., Goat Rock is a 2.5 mile hike through shady groves of redwood trees and sun-baked chaparral. At the summit, one will find perhaps a dozen bolts drilled into the rock that provide great anchors for any of the top rope routes on the rock. The greater ridge of Ben Lomond Mountain dominates the view to the south, blocking most of the view of the ocean, however, parts of Santa Cruz and the Monterey Bay are visible on a clear day.",
        "Climbing Season": "Goat Rock can get pretty crowded in the summer months, especially in the afternoons. It is best to get to Goat Rock early in the day to earn a spot on the rock, not to mention snagging a parking spot on Skyline Blvd. Compared to Indian Rock and Castle Rock, Goat Rock is sunnier.",
        "Gear":  "Long slings (up to 30 ft) are needed, though a couple of shoulder length runners will suffice for the majority of top-anchors.",
        "The Rock": "The uniquely shaped sandstone, with its caves, pockets, and bulbous features, is probably the main attraction for tourists, hikers, and of course, climbers at Castle Rock State Park. The sandstone, known as Vaqueros sandstone, has pockets and caves called tafoni carved out of it. In addition to the tafoni, the sandstone has honeycombed features, or fretwork, as well as large round spheres sticking out from the rock, what geologists refer to as cannonballs.<br><br>Over time, erosion has exposed the outer surface of the rock, which changes slowly due to weather factors such as rain and wind. The area is in an active fault zone. The epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, a 7.2 on the richter scale, was not far from here, and the San Andreas Fault divides the Los Trancos Open Space Preserve, only 9 miles to the north.",
        "Dogs": "Not allowed at Castle Rock State Park. They are allowed on leash at Indian Rock (across the street).",
        "Fees": "There is an $8 day use fee. If you want to avoid this parking fees, you can always park outside the main parking lot (there is almost always room)."
