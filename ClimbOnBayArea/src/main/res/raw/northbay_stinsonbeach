        "Description": "Located off Highway 1, Stinson Beach provides relaxed bouldering right next to the sea. Stinson Beach Boulders consists of two main rocks - Old Man Boulder and Are You Experienced Boulder. The Stinson beach market is great for post-climb meal.<br><br>Stinson Beach is a little crowded but should be almost empty near the south end of the beach (where all the bouldering is).<br><br>The difficulty of climbing depends on tide levels and the shifting of sand. It can be a little on the slick side depending on the fog level along the coast. <br><br>The rock quality is superb for the most part.",
        "When To Go": "Are You Experienced boulder is almost always good to climb. The Old Man Boulder is tide dependent.<br><br>Weather information - (415) 868-1922. <br>Tide predictions <br>http://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Stinson-Beach/tides/latest<br><br>",

        "Gear": "Crash pad for bouldering. Chalk might be helpful since rock gets wet. Towels if you hate sand and water. ",
        "The Rock":"The variance of rocks and formations at Mickey's and Stinson lead geologist to believe that the beaches lie on a strand of the San Andreas Fault zone that has crumbled and mixed up the myriad of rocks we now see there. Most of the climbing and bouldering rocks are meta-greywacke. A greywacke is a fine-grained sandstone with quartz, feldspar and various dark rock grains that are cemented into a fine-grained matrix."
